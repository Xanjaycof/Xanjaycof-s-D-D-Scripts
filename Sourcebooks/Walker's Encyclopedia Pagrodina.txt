Once I do, the vehicle gains enough arcane energy to stay powered for a number of hours equal to twice the level of the expended spell slot. The vehicle can only hold enough arcane energy to stay powered for 8 continuous hours. If U expend a spell slot that would provide more hours of arcane energy than the vehicle can hold, the extra energy is lost. The vehicle counts as a magical object while it is powered. It has an AC of 17 and a number of HP equal to five times my charioteer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 HP. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 HP, but I can assemble it again later if this occurs. If it is within 5 feet of me, I can disassemble it as an action. Once during my move, I can hop onto and begin operating the vehicle (if it is within 5 feet of me) or hop off. I do so by spending movement equal to half my speed. Only I can properly operate my custom-built vehicle, and I gain the following benefits while doing so if it is powered:\n   The vehicle provides you with a base speed of 50 feet, a climbing speed of 30 feet, and a swimming speed of 30 feet. I can use any of them in place of my own speeds.\n   I can use my bonus action to take the Dash action.\n   If my movement provokes an attack of opportunity, I can force the attack to target my vehicle instead of me.\n   When a spell or effect teleports me to another location, I can choose to bring the vehicle with me as long as there is enough space for it at the new location.",

		note : "\n   " + "Properties of the Gramophone: The gramophone is a Small musical instrument that can be held and operated with two hands. I have proficiency with the gramophone while you are attuned to it. It can play any and all records, though only specific records will create magical effects. Additionally, once a record ends, the player immediately resumes playing it from the beginning with no noticeable break in sound. The gramophone will continue to play unless it is stopped by me or if it is ever more than 60 feet away from me. Once during my turn, I can start or stop the gramophone (no action required). While it is stopped, I can use my action to change the record in the gramophone if you have a suitable record in your possession.\n   Properties of the Records: There are ten documented records that cause magical effects when played on the gramophone. It is unknown if more than ten such records exist. Each record holds one audio track of 3-4 minute duration that is composed and recorded to loop perfectly as the gramophone plays it from beginning to end repeatedly. When the gramophone is discovered, it has 1d6 of these magical records with it.\n   Spells: The gramophone has 5 charges. While holding it as it is playing a record, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it:\n     compulsion (2 charges)\n     magic mouth (1 charge)\n     private sanctum (2 charges)\n     irresistible dance (3 charges)\n     zone of truth (1 charge)\n   The gramophone regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.\n   Musical Knowledge: Attuning to the gramophone grants me a deeper understanding of music and songs, as well as their cultural orgins. Whenever I make an Intelligence check to discern information told through tunes or rhymes, I can add double my proficiency bonus to the check.\n   Record Scratch: While the gramophone is playing a record, I can use my action to scratch the record and aim the output towards a creature that I can see within 60 feet of me. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take a number of d6s equal to my proficiency bonus as thunder damage.\n   Disenchanting the Gramophone and Records: The Gramophone of Perpetuity and its magical records can be disenchanted if they spend seven continuous years buried beneath a road that is heavily traveled by non-gnome folk. Once seven years have passed, the buried objects lose their magical properties and become mundane.",
