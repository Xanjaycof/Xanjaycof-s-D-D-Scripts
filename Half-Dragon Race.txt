	descriptionFull : "Extensive training has granted me greater control over my Breath Weapon, allowing me to enhance its power and speed.\n   I regain the use of my Breath Weapon on a 5 or 6 on the d6 dice roll.\n   I gain empower points equal to my proficiency bonus. Each time I use my breath weapon I can expend an empower point and choose one of the following benefits:\n     I can use my breath weapon as a bonus action, its damage is increased by 2d6, or its range is doubled (30-foot cone or 60-feet long line that is 10 feet wide).\nI can only gain each benefit once per use of my breath weapon, but I can gain multiple different benefits at once.",

	descriptionFull : "I'm blessed by either Bahamut or Tiamat, granting me a lesser dragon form of my Draconic Ancestry's chosen dragon. I can use my bonus action to change into a large sized form of my ancestral dragon. My transformation lasts for 1 minute or until I end it as a bonus action. I can regain this form after finishing a long rest. My weapons merge with me, and the magical bonuses of my equipped melee weapons are transferred to my bite attack. If I'm able to attack with my claws, wings, or tail then I can continue to do so. This form doesn't hinder class abilities or spellcasting, nor the use of spell components. In addition, for each minute that I haven't entered combat while in this form, I can extend its duration by 1 minute, up to 10 minutes total. This form grants me the following benefits:\n I gain a flying speed of 30 feet\n I gain a bite attack, which I can use to make unarmed strikes. If I hit with them, I deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 (2d6 if I was wielding a two-handed weapon) + my Strength or Dexterity modifier (my choice). My bite counts as a finesse weapon. If I originally had a bite attack with a higher damage dice then I can use that one instead.\n I gain the effects of the Enlarge option from the enlarge/reduce spell.",

	descriptionFull : "I may now cast true polymorph once without expending a spell slot, but it only targets myself and I must change into my chosen dragon type. I may revert to my original form as a bonus action, and after losing this form, I regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when I finish a long rest. This replaces my Dragon Form transformation, if I have taken the Dragon Form feat. Like the normal true polymorph spell I must maintain my concentration in order to keep the spell active. After one hour the effects will be permanent (unless I use my bonus action to revert back to my original form, or when this True Dragon Form loses all of its HP) and I no longer need to maintain my concentration to remain in my True Dragon Form. My True Dragon Form's breath weapon replaces my original form's breath weapon, but it may also benefit from my Improved Breath Weapon feat.",
